My name is Manuel Boo, and I am a veterinarian and data scientist  
with a keen interest in research and innovation. I have completed 
a Master's in Machine Learning and Big Data in Medicine at the 
Universidad Aut√≥noma de Barcelona and now I'm seeking for a job to 
put in practice what I learned.

I have experience and deep knowledge in medicine, healthcare 
management and food production, industries thriving for IA solutions.
This is why I think I have a valuable skills set, combined with a big
motivation to learn new things. I am passionate about research and 
developement, but I am also open to any cutting-edge job that explores 
the possibilities of artificial intelligence and data science.
